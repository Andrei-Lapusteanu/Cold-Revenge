Main idea: A fun arena type shooter where your main goal is to eliminate the refrigerators attacking you.

Context of the game: "You're Steve, a refrigerator repair man. You were sent here to take care of the matter, but the fridges have other plans. Somehow they came to life and aren't happy to see you. Luck has it that you found a cannon that can fire vegetables, this should probably deal with the fridges."

 Survive for as long as you can and see what score you get.

Game aspects/features/mechanics:
- FPS
- Arena shooter
- Player system (movement, HP, cash)
- Weapon system (multiple ammo types, physical  projectiles, animations)
- Timed power-up system (double fire rate, fire three at once, invulnerability)
- Enemy system (manually modelled, animated, navigation agent, minimal AI)
	- Melee and ranged attack (fridges sometimes throw back what you shoot at them, how rude)
- UI system & game menus

Built using Unity 2019.2.6f1, fridge modeled in Maya, scripts have been written by me (except those from downloaded assets). Everything else gotten from the Unity Asset Store
